Dying Inside
------------
It's turning out just another day
I took a shower and I went on my way
I stopped there as usual
Had a coffee and pie
When i turned to leave
I couldn't believe my eyes

Standing there i didn't know what to say
Without one touch
We stood there face to face

Chorus
And i was dying indside to hold you
I couldn't believe what i felt for you
Dying inside i was dying inside
But i couldn't bring myself to touch you

You said hello then u asked my name
I didn't know if i should go all the way
Inside i felt my life have really changed
I knew that it would never be the same

Standing there i didn't know what to say
First time looked away when i whispered your name

And i was dying indside to hold you
I couldn't believe what i felt for you
Dying inside i was dying inside
But i couldn't bring myself to touch you

And i was dying indside to hold you
I couldn't believe what i felt for you
Dying inside i was dying inside
But i couldn't bring myself to touch you

One hello changed my life
I didn't believe in love at first sight
But you've shown me what is life
And I now i know my love (i know it's coming right)

And i was dying inside to hold you
I couldn't believe what i felt for you
Dying inside i was dying inside
But i couldn't bring myself to touch you
